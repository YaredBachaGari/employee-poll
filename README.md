# Employee Polls Project

Employees Poll is a web application designed to facilitate employee polling in a company. This app is built using React and fulfills the requirements of the React Nano Degree program at Udacity. The app allows employees to create polls with two choices, and other employees can participate in the voting. To ensure data privacy, the app requires users to sign in before creating, viewing, or voting in any poll. In addition to creating and voting in polls, employees can also view their voting history. The app includes a leaderboard page that summarizes the total number of employees who have participated in creating and voting in polls. This information can be used by HR to identify top performers and offer incentives or raises

## Built with

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Udacity for their excellent education and support during my learning journey. I am grateful for the challenge presented by this project, which has helped me to develop new skills in react-redux. Additionally, I appreciate the provision of the starter code, fake API and project requirements, which have allowed me to put my learning into practice and build a functional app.
